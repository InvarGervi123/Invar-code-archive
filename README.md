# Invar Code Archive

📃 This repository is a personal archive of my old programming projects, collected and organized under one place.
It contains various experiments, bot scripts, mini tools, games, and learning exercises — written across several years of exploration and learning.

> The original folder name before uploading was: **Bot-discord**

## 🧠 Why I Created This Archive

Over the years, I’ve written many small and large projects — some for learning, some just for fun.
Instead of letting them stay scattered across my computer, I wanted to:

* Back them up on GitHub
* See how far I’ve come as a developer
* Share my learning journey publicly

This repo shows my **growth** and **improvement** over time — from messy beginner scripts to more structured, meaningful code.

## 📂 What's Inside?

The repository contains code across many categories:

* 🤖 **Discord Bots** – experiments with bot logic and OpenAI integration
* 🧠 **AI + Python** – basic examples using OpenAI, GPT models, and logic
* 🎮 **Mini Games** – Uno clone, Doom-style projects, math puzzles
* 🌐 **Web Dev** – HTML/CSS projects, WebMath site
* 🪪 **Testing / Learning** – Java, Node.js, OOP concepts
* 🛠️ **Misc Tools** – image processing, JSON parsing, file tools

Some projects are full scripts, others just folders with ideas or half-written experiments.

## 🔐 Important Note

All secrets (API keys, tokens) have been **revoked and cleaned** from the history.
Do **not** reuse old keys or rely on any `main.py` that appears to include hardcoded tokens.

---

## 📁 Getting Started

Most folders can be opened directly in an IDE.
Some Python scripts may require:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or creating a `.env` file if you're running bots or AI-related projects.

## 📊 My Journey as a Developer

This repo is more than just code — it's my **timeline** of growth.
From copy-pasting beginner code to building more confident, modular, and purposeful logic.

Even if some projects are outdated or messy, I’m proud of all of it — because every file here taught me something.
This is my **proof of progress** 🛠️💡
